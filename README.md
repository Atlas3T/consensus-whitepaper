# Technical White Paper 

This is the full technical whitepaper for the Catalyst network. Within which are a blueprint for the consensus and transaction mechanisms. As well as other elements of the overall project needed for the functionality of the network. 

## Getting Started

The pdf file is accesable from the Catalyst Technical Paper folder. The pdf should be up to date however to ensure this, open the Catalyst Technical Paper.tex and run in any LaTeX editor. Within the Catalyst Technical Paper folder the excel spreadsheet describes the file structure and file paths. When making any changes to the file structure, ensure that this excel is also updated. Each chapter and section of the paper should have its own .tex file. Subsections will be integrated into their parent section (Unless the subsection is unusually long).

### Prerequisites

For running and editing LaTeX files use TexWorks - https://sourceforge.net/projects/texworks.mirror/ for MacOS, Windows and Linux. 

### Installing

The files are structured according to the excel file Folder Structure. The primary .tex file is under Catalyst Technical Paper.tex. The pdf should be compiled from here. All changes to the text in the document should be made to the relevant .tex file within Paper_Tex_Files. Graphs and graphics should be added to the Figures folder. When linking new figures from a .tex document, the main file Catalyst Technical Paper.tex should be considered the root. 

## Contribution Requirements 

* File System must be in tact and documented of excel table 
* All figures must be held within the relevant figures folder 
* Pdf must automatically generate when used on LaTeX editor 

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
