Different types of accounts  are supported on Catalyst ledger. Namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item Non-confidential user-based accounts, with a balance in KAT tokens that is updated via the validation of non-confidential transactions. The account balance is visible to all.
\item Confidential user-based accounts, with a balance in KAT tokens that is updated through the validation of confidential transactions. The account balance is hidden, only known to the account holder.
\item Smart contract-based accounts. A smart contract-based account has an associated code that can be triggered by transactions or messages generated by other code.
\end{itemize}

An account is defined by the following components: 

\begin{itemize}
\item An address component: a 32-byte address $A_{i}$, which is derived from a public/private key pair \{$Q_{i},k_{i}$\} (where $Q_i= k_{i}G$) using a collision-resistant hash function ($\mathcal{H}$): $A_{i} = \mathcal{H}(Q_{i})$.
\item An amount component: when non-confidential, the amount is a 8-byte number $v_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}_M$ (with $M$ the maximum number of tokens defined on Catalyst system). This represents the account $A_{i}$ balance in KAT tokens. When confidential the amount component is a 32-byte Pedersen Commitment~\cite{confidential} $C_{i} = v_{i}H + b_{i}G$ that hides the balance of the account using a blinding factor $b_{i} \in  \mathbb{Z}_p$.
\item A data component: reserved to smart contract-based accounts and is used to store data that amounts to a maximum of $x$ bytes. 
\end{itemize}

As such, Catalyst ledger state is naturally split into sub-states, or shards, where each shard stores accounts of a given type. A node on Catalyst network may not maintain a copy of all shards but must remain aware of the possible dependencies among shards\footnote{Chapter discussing sharding techniques applied to Catalyst under construction.}.%  (see chapter~\ref{Cha:Sha}).\\
