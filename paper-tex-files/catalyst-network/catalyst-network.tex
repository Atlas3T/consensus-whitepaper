Peer-to-peer communication allows messages (including but not limited to transactions) to be propagated across a network. Peer-to-peer networks rely upon information to be passed between nodes in a fast and efficient manner. The protocol used to propagate messages needs to be such that the large majority of nodes receive accurate messages in a timely manner. Catalyst implements a gossip protocol to propagate messages amongst peers. Gossip protocols, also known as epidemic protocols are named as such because of how they spread information. Each node propagates a message to a number of its connected peers, randomly chosen amongst nodes in the network. As nodes receive the message they propagate the message their peers. This allows the message to spread rapidly with a high level of coverage.
