Hashing generally refers to algorithms used to obfuscate data by generating a summary of the data, or hash, in such a way that the original data can not be restored using the hash, \textit{i.e.} the hashing function is a one-way function. The hash can be used to prove knowledge or ownership of the original data. A hashing function generates a pseudo-random string of fixed length from a data of arbitrary length. The hashing algorithm is said to be collision-resistant when the probability to generate the same hash from two different data is negligible. Furthermore, a hashing algorithm has the property that two similar data will lead to very different hashes, that is to say a collection of hashes does not allow an entity unaware of the original data to acquire knowledge about the data. \\ 

The hashing algorithm used on Catalyst ledger is Blake2b-256 (or simply Blake2b) which produces a 256-bits string and is known to be amongst the fastest hashing algorithms and particularly suitable for mobile applications~\cite{blake}. Throughout the document, the hashing function is referenced by the symbol $\mathcal{H}$.
