Whenever financial value is stored on a distributed system, there will be greater incentive to attack the system in the attempt to take control of financial assets or simply disrupt the system to create or destroy existing assets. This is why security against attack on DLT must be of the most grave importance. With no centralised entity to control access and check validity it is up to the peers on the network to ensure its security. Through consensus and the underlying protocols of the network a secure environment must be created to allow transactions to take place in a trust-less environment.
